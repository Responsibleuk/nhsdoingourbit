# NHS Doing Our Bit

DoingOurBit is aiming to be the largest platform in the world offering free wellbeing on demand and live classes to frontline workers.

The site has 2 distinct audiences, frontline workers and wellbeing professionals.

How It Started
DoingOurBit started as a "passion project" during the Covid-19 pandemic when Julie Davis, Deputy Chief Operating Officer at the Clinical Research Network West Midlands, wanted to support her 190 colleagues by giving them access to free fitness sessions. Her neighbouring Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust heard about this and wanted to share with its 10,000 staff. All of a sudden, Julie needed a bigger platform, additional expertise and help.

How It's Going
Leading fitness industry businesses Active IQ, Study Active and fibodo quickly stepped up. Sharing Julie's vision, they helped to create Doing Our Bit which launched in June 2020. Today, over 100 NHS trusts have signed up, giving over 700,000 NHS staff access to the free workouts.

What's Next
We want to make Doing Our Bit the largest free platform supporting the wellbeing of frontline workers in the world. So we need more content, more creators, more diversity, more knowledge shared.


## Features 

This website will be used to inform NHS and social care workers about the free wellbeing services available to them. It will also be a way for wellbeing professionals to register to provide their services for free to frontline workers.

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
