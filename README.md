# NHS Doing Our Bit

DoingOurBit is aiming to be the largest platform in the world offering free wellbeing on demand and live classes to frontline workers.

The site has 2 distinct audiences, frontline workers and wellbeing professionals.

How It Started
DoingOurBit started as a "passion project" during the Covid-19 pandemic when Julie Davis, Deputy Chief Operating Officer at the Clinical Research Network West Midlands, wanted to support her 190 colleagues by giving them access to free fitness sessions. Her neighbouring Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust heard about this and wanted to share with its 10,000 staff. All of a sudden, Julie needed a bigger platform, additional expertise and help.

How It's Going
Leading fitness industry businesses Active IQ, Study Active and fibodo quickly stepped up. Sharing Julie's vision, they helped to create Doing Our Bit which launched in June 2020. Today, over 100 NHS trusts have signed up, giving over 700,000 NHS staff access to the free workouts.

What's Next
We want to make Doing Our Bit the largest free platform supporting the wellbeing of frontline workers in the world. So we need more content, more creators, more diversity, more knowledge shared.
